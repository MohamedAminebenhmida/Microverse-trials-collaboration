      JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
      is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
      example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
      its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
    </p>

    <p>
      JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
      and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
      structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
      variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
      example:
    </p>
    <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>

      JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
      in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
      Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
      Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
      constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
      JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
      declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
      number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
      JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
      class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
      inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
      JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
      requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
      loosely typed methods.
