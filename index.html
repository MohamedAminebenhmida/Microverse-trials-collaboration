              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
              is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
              example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
              its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>

            <p>
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
              and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
              structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
              variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
              example:
            </p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
              greetMe("World");
            </code>
          </section>

          <section class="main-section" id="section2">
            <header>
              <h1>section2</h1>

              JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
              in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
              Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
              Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
              constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
              JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
              declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
              number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
              JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
              class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
              inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
              JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
              requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
              loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");
      </code>
            <ul>
              <li>item 4</li>
              <li>item 5</li>
            </ul>
